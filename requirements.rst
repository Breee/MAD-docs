MAD requires the following things to be installed available on your server:

- a server/computer running Linux. RaspberryPis do work, but aren't recommended
- MariaDB server (MySQL has some issues and is not recommended)
- Python 3.6 (or higher) + Python's package manager command line tool :code:`pip`
- a rooted Android device being able to run the game. See `this list <https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD-device-list>`_ of tested devices
